# Azure SQL Server Database Deployment Template

Deploy an Azure SQL Server that contains a single database. This template is
often embedded into more complex deployments. Thus, it's highly parameterised.

Azure SQL is a managed service. It's readily scaled up and down to meet demand,
and is effectively serverless.
